/**
 * This kind of collection provides advanced operations compared to basic
 * collections, such as insertion, extraction, and inspection.
 * <p>
 * Generally, a queue orders its elements by means of first-in-first-out.
 * However, a priority queue orders its elements according to a comparator
 * specified or the elements' natural order. Furthermore, a stack orders its
 * elements last-in-first out.
 * <p>
 * A typical queue does not allow {@code null} to be inserted as its element,
 * while some implementations such as {@code LinkedList} allow it. But {@code
 * null} should not be inserted even in these implementations, since the method
 * {@code poll} returns {@code null} to indicate that there is no element left
 * in the queue.
 * <p>
 * {@code Queue} does not provide blocking queue methods, which would block
 * until the operation of the method is allowed. See the
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue} interface for information about
 * blocking queue methods.

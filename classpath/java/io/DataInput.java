/**
 * Defines an interface for classes that are able to read typed data from some
 * source. Typically, this data has been written by a class which implements
 * {@link DataOutput}. Types that can be read include byte, 16-bit short, 32-bit
 * int, 32-bit float, 64-bit long, 64-bit double, byte strings, and MUTF-8
 * strings.
 *
 * <h3>MUTF-8 (Modified UTF-8) Encoding</h3>
 * <p>
 * When encoding strings as UTF, implementations of {@code DataInput} and
 * {@code DataOutput} use a slightly modified form of UTF-8, hereafter referred
 * to as MUTF-8. This form is identical to standard UTF-8, except:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Only the one-, two-, and three-byte encodings are used.</li>
 * <li>Code points in the range <code>U+10000</code> &hellip;
 * <code>U+10ffff</code> are encoded as a surrogate pair, each of which is
 * represented as a three-byte encoded value.</li>
 * <li>The code point <code>U+0000</code> is encoded in two-byte form.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Please refer to <a href="http://unicode.org">The Unicode Standard</a> for
 * further information about character encoding. MUTF-8 is actually closer to
 * the (relatively less well-known) encoding <a
 * href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr26/">CESU-8</a> than to UTF-8 per se.
